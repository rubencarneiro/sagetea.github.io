# Name Schema

```txt
v2/schema/device.schema.yml#/properties/name
```

The human-readable name under which the device was marketed. This includes the name of the manufacturer if it makes sense. I.e. you would not refer to the 'Oneplus One' as 'One', but you would not call the 'iPhone 9' 'Apple iPhone 9'. Use common sense.
